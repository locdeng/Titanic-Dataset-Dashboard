# Titanic Survivors Analysis Dashboard 🚢

A Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for analyzing and predicting survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset. This project includes data exploration, visualization, and machine learning model deployment for educational and demonstration purposes.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This personal project focuses on exploring the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to survival based on variables like gender, age, and ticket class. A Random Forest classifier is trained to predict survival outcomes, and the results are presented through an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

## 📌 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering using **Pandas**
- Exploratory data analysis with **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**
- Machine learning model building using **scikit-learn**
- Interactive dashboard creation using **Streamlit**
- Model performance evaluation with **Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **F1 Score**
- Deployed dashboard for user interaction via web
